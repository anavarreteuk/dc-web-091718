# Rails API
- Dynamic web pages with JS front end and Rails backend
- Single page application

### Why?
- Respond with request for data with data (json)
- Manage large database (update/add rows)
- Use relationship between models

### Getting Started
`rails new --api <project_name>`

### Useful Rails Commands
- `rails g model cat`
- `rake db:migrate rake db:seed`
- `rails g controller cats`
- `rails g serializer cat`

### CORS
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing

### Serializer

### CRUD


### Transition to Project Mode
- You don't have to do all the JSON API labs, just until you're comfortable
- For your project, at least two models, preferably one model has CRUD
- Uses OOJS!!!
