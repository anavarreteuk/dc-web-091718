# Intro To React

## Challenges With Mod 3 Apps
- appendChild all the places
   - manual DOM manipulation
   - query the DOM
- what should be rendered/passed?
- feedback loop


In vanilla JS
 - imperative coding
In react
 - declarative coding



## Creating a React App
- `create-react-app <app_name>`
- `npm install`

## Node, Node Package Manager, package.json

## Webpack and Modular JS
- Webpack is the tool and combines all files into bundle.js
- performance boosting

## JSX and Babel
- JSX refers to the syntax
- Babel is the tool and translate JSX into React.createElement to make sure it works in the browser
- developers can code what app should look like, instead of managing the DOM



## Thinking in Components: class vs. functional

#### functional
- shorter to write
- "dumber" if you don't have any fancy stuff to add

#### class
- class <nameOfComponent> extends React.Component {
  - must have render()
}
